# scrapeAF

*This project has been depreciated in favour of [HLAfreq](https://github.com/BarinthusBio/HLAfreq)*.

The aim of this tool is to be able to estimate the HLA allele
frequencies at large multi population scale, e.g. globally.
Scrape allele frequency data from
[allele frequencies.net](http://www.allelefrequencies.net/).
This gives frequencies by population, which can be averaged
across studies, weighted by sample size. Frequencies can then
be averaged across populations if a relative weighting can
found, i.e. population size.
